It includes essential requirements for the\nprotection of health and safety, of electromagnetic compatibility\nand for the avoidance of harmful interference. These requirements\nare translated into technical requirements within non-mandatory\nharmonised standards, as in other &#145;New Approach&#146;\nlegislation. Whilst a fundamental revision of the Directive is not\nnecessary, experience in the operation of the Directive has\nhighlighted a number of issues to be addressed, principally\nregarding compliance and clarification.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal is accompanied by an\n<a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=SWD:2012:0300:FIN:EN:PDF\">impact\nassessment</a>. Overall, there is a high level of consensus and\nsupport for aligning the Directive with the New Legislative\nFramework package and for clarifying and simplifying the Directive.\nOpinions are more divided on the possible introduction of a\nrequirement to register products prior to their placing on the\nmarket, and on some measures for administrative\nsimplification&#160;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the\nFunctioning of the European Union.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">CONTENT : the main objectives of the proposal\nare:</span></p>\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0cm\" type=\"disc\">\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">to improve the level of compliance</span></b> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">with the requirements in the Directive, and to\nincrease the confidence of all stakeholders in the regulatory\nframework;</span></li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">to clarify and simplify the Directive</span></b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">, including some limited adaptations of scope, so as\nto facilitate its application and eliminate unnecessary burden for\neconomic operators and public authorities.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The proposed revision also allows better integration\nof the Directive with other related EU Legislation, particularly\nDecision No 676/2002/EC (the Radio Spectrum Decision).</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The initiative is consistent with the New Legislative\nFramework package approved in 2008, comprised of: (i) Regulation No\n(EC) 765/2008 on accreditation and market surveillance and (ii) of\nDecision No (EC)768/2008 establishing a common framework for the\nmarketing of products, which provides that its provisions are to be\nused when legislation is drafted or revised.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">The most significant elements of the proposal for a\nrevision of the Directive are the following:</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"font-weight: bold; text-align: justify\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Alignment with Decision 768/2008/EC on a common\nframework for the marketing of products, including:</span></p>\n<ul style=\"margin-top:0cm\" type=\"disc\">\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">the definitions set out in chapter R1 of Decision\n768/2008/EC;</span></li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">the obligations of economic operators set out in\nchapter R2 of Decision 768/2008/EC;</span></li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">three modules for conformity assessment set out in\nAnnex II of Decision 768/2008/EC;</span></li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">the obligations for the notification of conformity\nassessment bodies set out in chapter R4 of Decision\n768/2008/EC;</span></li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">the simplified safeguard procedures set out in chapter\nR5 of Decision 768/2008/EC.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:justify\"><b><span lang=\"EN-GB\">New definition of &#145;radio\nequipment&#146;:</span></b> <span lang=\"EN-GB\">this demarcates the\nmodified scope of the Directive, and includes all and only\nequipment, which intentionally transmits signals using radio\nspectrum, whether for the purpose of communication or other.

The proposal is closely related to the implementation of the\nNew Legislative Framework (NLF) adopted in 2008 as \"the goods package\".\n\nThe R&TTE Directive establishes a framework for the placing on the market, free movement\nand putting into service in the EU of radio equipment and telecommunications terminal\nequipment. The Directive entered into force in 1999 and has been crucial to achieving an\ninternal market in this area. The Directive includes essential requirements for the protection of\nhealth and safety, of electromagnetic compatibility and for the avoidance of harmful\ninterference. These requirements are translated into technical requirements within non-\nmandatory harmonised standards, as in other \u2018New Approach\u2019 legislation.\n\nThe number of mobile devices and wireless applications has grown enormously in recent\nyears. This creates risks of interference between the various products. Therefore an efficient\nuse of the radio spectrum is essential.\n\nExisting provisions in the area of the proposal\n\nThe R&TTE Directive fully harmonises the placing on the EU market of the products falling\nwithin its scope. Only equipment complying with the requirements of the Directive may be\nplaced on the market, and Member States may not introduce further restrictions addressing at\nnational level the same requirements. Putting into service and use of radio equipment is\nsubject to national regulation. When exercising this competence, Member States must comply\nwith applicable EU law, in particular:\n\n     \u2022    The general framework for spectrum policy set out in the Radio Spectrum Policy\n          Programme;\n\n     \u2022    General criteria laid down in Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive) within\n          the regulatory framework for electronic communications;\n\n     \u2022    Conditions for authorisations for the use of spectrum laid down in Directive\n          2002/20/EC (Authorisation Directive) within the regulatory framework for electronic\n          communications;\n\n     \u2022    Implementing measures under Decision 676/2002/EC (Radio Spectrum Decision)\n          harmonising the technical conditions for the use of certain spectrum bands in the EU\n          and that are binding on all Member States. Examples of bands harmonised at EU\n\n1\n         OJ L 91, 7.4.1999, p. 10.\n         level include the bands for GSM, UMTS and shortrange devices;\n\n     \u2022   Consistency with the other policies and objectives of the Union.\n\nRapporteur's Position\n\nYour rapporteur welcomes the proposal of the European Commission. However, she suggests\nto introduce a number of horizontal and vertical changes in order to avoid unnecessary\nadministrative burden, which would particularly affect SMEs, while securing a very high\nlevel of consumer protection, the most efficient use of the radio spectrum, improving market\nsurveillance, reaching a higher level of consistency with the New Legislative Framework and\neliminating possible inconsistencies in the text which may otherwise create legal uncertainty.\n\nHorizontal Issues\n\nYour rapporteur identified several inconsistencies with the \"Goods Package\", which has\nalready been discussed at European level. In order to align with these results and achieve a\ncoherent legislative framework, your rapporteur suggests improvements of the wording.\n\nVertical Issues\n\nYour rapporteur agrees with the general direction of the Proposal. Nevertheless, there are a\nnumber of issues specific to the Directive where changes are necessary in order to strike the\nright balance between effective market surveillance and avoidance of unnecessary\nadministrative burden especially for SMEs.\n\n     a) A number of products that entail a very limited use of electromagnetic waves for the\n        purpose other than communication are already present on the market without any\n        major reported problems and are sufficiently regulated by e.g. LVD and EMC\n        Directives therefore it is not proportionate to extend the scope of the proposed\n        regulation to include such devices.\n\n     b) Moreover and considering that radio spectrum is a finite resource, it is important to\n        guarantee its efficient usage, therefore the equipment capable of receiving radio\n        waves should fall under the scope of proposed Directive.\n\n         Your rapporteur consequently considers important to change the definition of \"radio\n         equipment\" accordingly.\n\n     c) The obligation to register certain radio equipment in a central system would result\n        into disproportionate burden to legitimate economic operators, especially SMEs,\n        whereas the benefits of such registration system have not been sufficiently\n        demonstrated. Moreover, such system potentially raises confidentiality issues.\n        Furthermore, the respective provisions on traceability as established in the proposed\n        Directive are a sufficient tool for efficient and effective market surveillance.\n\n     d) Member States should encourage economic operators to include not only a postal\n        address but in addition to that also a website address in order to facilitate the\n        communication between economic operators, market surveillance authorities and\n        consumers.\n\nYour rapporteur welcomes the fact that the Proposal highlights the benefits of interoperability\nbetween radio equipment and accessories such as chargers. However, there needs to be a\nrenewed effort to introduce a common charger. This would simplify the use of radio\nequipment e.g. mobile phones, reduce waste and costs as well as will consequently be highly\nbeneficial to consumers.",

It includes essential requirements for the\nprotection of health and safety, of electromagnetic compatibility\nand for the avoidance of harmful interference. These requirements\nare translated into technical requirements within non-mandatory\nharmonised standards, as in other &#145;New Approach&#146;\nlegislation.
